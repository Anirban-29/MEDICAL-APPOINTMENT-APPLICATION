# MEDICAL-APPOINTMENT-APPLICATION
THIS A GUI TO TAKE AND MANAGE APPOINTMENTS 
# INTRODUCTION
There is majorly 2 parts 1st is the DATABASE-SERVER and the 2nd APPOINTMENT-CLIENT.The DATABASESERVER part is run by the organization to take appointment and the appointment client part is run by the clients who wants to register or take any appointment.Here I have use the UDP protocol(USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL) which is faster than the TCP protocol.I have also implemented a check to track any data loss by using acknowledgement message.In the database side there is also a checking condition to stop any duplicate entry.
# HOW TO USE SERVER
At first the database file to store the appointment is created.Then DATABASESERVER.py file is to be executed which will track any incoming connection and the appointments.After executing the DATABASESERVER.py file they need to click the START button to start the server which will wait for incoming connection and show a pop up that successfully started the server.When the SHOW button is clicked it will show the list of appointment.Remember that efore executing the file the database file showed be created were the data will be stored.
# APPOINTMENT CLIENT
In case of client the APPOINTMENTCLIENT.py file is executed.When executed a gui will pop up where the details would be filled by the patient.The patient has to fill the details like NAME OF PATIENT ,DATE ,SELECT the time from 11am-1pm,2pm-5pm,6pm-9pm and also enter the server id(unique for every server) in which he or she is registering.And then click o the REGISTER button to register in case of successful registration a pop up will show "successfully registered" and in case of duplicated entry a pop will show "Error Already Registered".
